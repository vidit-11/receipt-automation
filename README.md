# receipt-automation
Automated Receipt Processing System on AWS
This project automates the entire receipt processing workflow, transforming raw receipt images into structured, actionable data and delivering key insights directly to your inbox. It's designed to streamline expense tracking and data entry by leveraging a serverless architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS). <br><br>
# Core Functionalities: <br>
 * Receipt Ingestion: Users upload receipt images (e.g., JPEG, PNG) to a designated Amazon S3 bucket. This S3 bucket acts as the primary input for the system, triggering the subsequent processing steps.
 * Intelligent Data Extraction: Upon a new image upload to S3, an AWS Lambda function is automatically invoked. This Lambda function orchestrates the data extraction by calling AWS Textract. Textract intelligently analyzes the receipt image, identifying and extracting key information such as the vendor name, total amount, date of purchase, individual line items, and other relevant details.
 * Data Persistence: The extracted and structured receipt data is then stored in a scalable and highly available Amazon DynamoDB table. DynamoDB's NoSQL nature makes it ideal for storing flexible receipt data, enabling easy retrieval, querying, and integration with other applications for analysis or reporting.
 * Automated Notifications: Once the data is extracted and stored, a concise summary of the key details from the processed receipt is automatically formatted into an email. This email is then sent to pre-configured recipients (e.g., finance department, individual users) using Amazon SES (Simple Email Service), providing instant access to the extracted information.<br><br>
# Architecture Overview:<br>
The system follows a serverless event-driven architecture:<br>
 * S3 Event Notification: An S3 event notification is configured to trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever a new object (receipt image) is uploaded to the input S3 bucket.
 * Lambda Function Execution: The Lambda function, written in Python (or your preferred runtime), receives the S3 event.
 * Textract Integration: The Lambda function calls the AWS Textract API, passing the S3 object reference for the uploaded receipt. Textract processes the image asynchronously and returns the extracted text and structured data.
 * DynamoDB Storage: The Lambda function then parses Textract's response and writes the relevant data fields into a specified DynamoDB table.
 * SES Email Delivery: Finally, the Lambda function composes an email with the extracted key points and sends it using Amazon SES. <br><br>
# Getting Started:
To deploy and run this project, you will need an AWS account and familiarity with basic AWS services.<br>
Prerequisites:
 * AWS Account
 * AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
 * Node.js/Python (for Lambda function development, depending on your choice)
 * Serverless Framework (optional, but highly recommended for deployment) or AWS CloudFormation/Terraform. <br>
# Deployment Steps (High-Level):
 * Create S3 Bucket: Set up an S3 bucket for receipt uploads.
 * Configure IAM Roles: Create IAM roles with necessary permissions for Lambda to access S3, Textract, DynamoDB, and SES.
 * Develop Lambda Function: Write the Lambda function code to handle the S3 event, call Textract, store in DynamoDB, and send emails via SES.
 * Create DynamoDB Table: Define your DynamoDB table schema to store receipt data.
 * Configure SES: Verify your email addresses/domains in SES for sending notifications.
 * Deploy: Use CloudFormation, Serverless Framework, or AWS CLI to deploy the Lambda function, S3 event triggers, and other necessary resources.<br><br>
# Future Enhancements:<br>
 * User Interface: Develop a simple web-based user interface for easier receipt uploads and viewing of processed data.
 * Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and detailed logging for better monitoring and debugging.
 * Advanced Data Validation: Add validation logic to extracted data (e.g., date formats, currency validation).
 * Reporting and Analytics: Integrate with AWS QuickSight or other BI tools for advanced reporting on expenses.
 * Multi-User Support: Implement authentication and authorization for multiple users and separate data access.
 * Integration with Accounting Software: Connect with popular accounting platforms (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero) for direct data export.
